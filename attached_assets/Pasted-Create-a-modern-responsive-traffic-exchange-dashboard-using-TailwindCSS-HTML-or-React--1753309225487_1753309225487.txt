Create a modern, responsive **traffic exchange dashboard** using **TailwindCSS + HTML (or React)**.

🧠 Design Requirements:

✅ 1. TOP NAVBAR (Like GetHit + SkyHit):
- Sticky top navbar with soft shadow and light blur
- Left: Logo like SkyHit → “🚀 SkyHit” styled with futuristic rounded font
- Middle links:
   | Dashboard | Download & Earn Hits | Websites | My Referrals | Settings |
- Right:
   👤 “Hello, Aritra Mahatma” and 🔴 “Sign Out” button (rounded pill)

💜 Color Scheme:
- Use **SkyHit color theme**:
   - Purple gradient background (#6A00FF → #9B5FFF)
   - White cards with soft glow and blur
   - Accent elements: Neon Pink (#FF48C4), Soft Violet (#D7C2FF)
- Rounded corners everywhere (use Tailwind: `rounded-2xl`, `shadow-lg`, `bg-opacity-60`)

📊 2. TRAFFIC STATISTICS SECTION (From GetHit):
- Section title: **"Traffic Statistics"** with 📈 icon
- Grid layout: 3x2 (responsive)
   Each card:
   - Hits Available (✨)
   - Hits Received (📩)
   - No. of Domains (🌐)
   - No. of Links (🔗)
   - Referrals (👥)
   - Active Exchange Sessions (🔁)
- Each box styled with:
   - White glassmorphism (`bg-white bg-opacity-20 backdrop-blur`)
   - Hover: glow (`hover:shadow-2xl`)
   - Icon, big number, label

🌍 Add optional animated globe (SVG or CSS) on right side like GetHit

🚀 3. CAMPAIGN LAUNCH CENTER (From TrafficFlow):
- Title: 🎯 “Campaign Launch Center”
- Inputs:
   - Target Website (text field)
   - Target Volume (1–10,000 hits) [slider or number input]
   - Duration (0.5–24 hrs) [dropdown]
   - Traffic Quality (Page Views / Clicks / Time)
- Launch Campaign button → glowing gradient button (neon style)

📈 4. CAMPAIGN CONTROL PANEL:
- Show active campaigns like:
   - Blog URL (highlighted)
   - Live status (🟢 or 🔴)
   - Hits Progress Bar (gradient fill)
   - Remaining time
   - Buttons: Visit | Stop
- Use layout style of TrafficFlow (your 3rd image), but cleaner & smooth

🎯 5. FOOTER:
- Copyright © 2025 SkyHit
- Social icons (Twitter, Telegram, GitHub)
- "Built on Replit" logo (small)

✨ Animation & Styling:
- Use `transition-all`, `ease-in-out`, `duration-300` for hover and load animations
- Responsive: Mobile first, use `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Fonts: Use a modern Google Font like “Poppins” or “Outfit”
- UI should feel like a mix of SaaS + futuristic dashboard
